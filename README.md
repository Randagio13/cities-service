## Mission

- I've never found any complete library to get all world countries, states, and cities. I want to develop the best one. Of course, contributors are welcome!!
- I took this [data](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database) as a starting point.
- This package is a part of [countries-states-cities-service](https://github.com/Randagio13/countries-states-cities-service)

## Getting started

To get started with this library, you need to install it and add it to your project.

### Installation

Cities Service is available as an npm package.

```bash
# npm
npm install @ac-dev/cities-service

# yarn
yarn add @ac-dev/cities-service
```

### Import

Import single named import as follow:

```typescript
import { Cities } from '@ac-dev/cities-service'
```

## Usage

The code snippet below shows how to put into action `cities-service` in some common use cases.

- Get all cities.

```typescript
const cities = Cities.getCities()
```

- Get all cities by `asc` sort.

```typescript

  sort: {
    mode: 'alphabetical',

  filters: {
    country_code: 'IT',
  },
})
```

  filters: {
    country_code: ['IT', 'FR'],
